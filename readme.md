Chord in DataProvider
=====================

* Chords - See how to specify alternate name

* Remove the method in the Component and generate variable (to optimise)

* Fix the chord-name when they are in English, to remove the space "A m" to "Am"

* See if String is an existing ionic/angular classes (and rename it if it is)

* See why Object.assign is overwritting the main attributes (config['aaa']['bbb'] with config['aaa']['ccc'] will be ['aaa']['ccc'] instead of ['aaa']['ccc'] AND ['aaa']['bbb'])
