=====================

* Chords - See how to specify alternate name

* Remove the method in the Component and generate variable (to optimise)

* Fix the note-name when they are in English, to remove the space "A m" to "Am"

* See if String is an existing ionic/angular classes (and rename it if it is)

* Quiz - Configuration: Add the possibility to include/exclude direction UP or DOWN

* Notes - Add other clef (and options to change it)
